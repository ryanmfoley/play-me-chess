# Play-Me-Chess

## Description:

<strong>Play-Me-Chess</strong> is a chess app that I built from scratch using Vanilla JavaScript. This app uses user authentication so new users will have to sign up then log in. After logging in you're brought to the lobby where you can create a new game or join an existing game.

## Technologies Used:

- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB

<u><strong>Front-end:</strong></u>

- JavaScript
